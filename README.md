Age UK Volunteer Matching Service
===================

This app was developed over the course of three days for the **Hack for Heroes** hackathon hosted by Makers Academy. Developers of the app were: |  [Daria Thompson](https://github.com/dariathompson) | [David Stewart](https://github.com/DavidStewartLDN) |  [Kate Haffenden](https://github.com/naeglinghaff) | [Lila Walker](https://github.com/lilawalker) | [Patrick Oliver](https://github.com/poliver24) | [Stephan Ellenberger](https://github.com/stellenberger) | [Tom Ratcliffe](https://github.com/ratcliffetj)

Special thanks to [Ben Gittins](https://github.com/squareben1) and [Karlo de Guzman](https://github.com/Kdeg0040) for their contributions at the start of the project.

**Hack for Heroes:** This project won second prize in the hackathon. The challenge was to build ground-breaking projects to support key workers on the frontline.\
\
**The Brief:** This was contributed to the Hackathon by an Age UK employee. Essentially, create an app that allows seniors and volunteers to match based on mutual interests and hobbies. Similar to a dating app but optimised for users that may be less tech savvy. The profiles should include name, some details about the person and what their interests are.\
